# Task

Here you need to build an application which can calculate the salary of employees.
We need to have an **expandable** system of bonuses or deductions.

### Explanation
-  Country Tax for salaries is 20%
- If an employee older than 50 we want to add 7% to his salary
- If an employee has more than 2 kids we want to decrease his Tax by 2%
- If an employee wants to use a company car we need to deduct $500.
